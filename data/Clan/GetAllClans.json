We look out for existing DoD's who may have also lost their regular Fireteam, Friends have moved onto other games, or simply their old clan has become inactive. The Lost Boys is full of knowledge, and helpful people who will sacrifice their own personal progression to get others through anything Destiny related, while maintaining a strong belief that we are all equal.

Knowing that there were other Guardians scattered across the solar system fighting the Darkness alone, we formed this clan to bring them together. No guardian should have to fight the Darkness alone. We are a very active clan made up of parents, college students, and other walks of life. We are a mature group, we are not elitists although we may joke about some members being so. We are very active and organize our games using our the100.io group. We have a great blend of PVE and PVP members, especially during Iron Banner times. We are always willing to help our members get things accomplished such as exotic bounties, missions, and raid clears. So please, if you are in need of a Destiny clan, family, and friends feel free to message one of our founders or current members and let us know. As always, Keep your eyes up Guardians and we will see you on the battlefield. -Kupe81","motto":"Just everyday players in combat","tag":"EPCB","name":"EPIC Bravo Squad"},{"groupId":2805186,"medalUnlocks":[],"backgroundIcon":"https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny2_content/icons/cb_decal_square_382464cf640f1e22de3e1099428bb07a.png","foregroundIcon":"https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny2_content/icons/cb_decal_square_9edc72700cc9454c575f557a11d1e611.png","backgroundColor":"#1C1C23","emblemColor2":"#E7E7B4","emblemColor1":"#B54134","description":"Get ready for raiding","motto":"Skyiat","tag":"EpiK","name":"EpiK"},{"groupId":845941,"medalUnlocks":[],"backgroundIcon":"https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny2_content/icons/cb_decal_square_16a1ba1bfc6b49d36e219f5639b3802b.png","foregroundIcon":"https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny2_content/icons/cb_decal_square_7c4648bf7b7a87c7af3893aca9f05baa.png","backgroundColor":"#1C1C23","emblemColor2":"#9D242E","emblemColor1":"#7E7E7E","description":"Vaulted Aetheon's glass Ass\nCrota gave us the hives\nOryx dun took our butts\nFelt the machines wrath\nCan't wait for what's next!","motto":"Going cabals deep in the hell mouth","tag":"EMW","name":"Eris Morning Wood"},{"groupId":1557031,"medalUnlocks":[{"medalTier":1,"count":5,"unlockId":5,"description":"Had over 50% clan member participation in an event","name":"The more you give, the more you get"}],"backgroundIcon":"https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny2_content/icons/cb_decal_square_992878861157c91bdc3206b50fb2b912.png","foregroundIcon":"https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny2_content/icons/cb_decal_square_d9bc14a63c1eb85be0417dda98a1a6a0.png","backgroundColor":"#24252E","emblemColor2":"#7E7E7E","emblemColor1":"#F2591F","description":"destiny took the lot","motto":"it hurts, but in a good way","tag":"G4SH","name":"Eris Morns Shaxx Wound"},{"groupId":2416686,"medalUnlocks":[],"backgroundIcon":"https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny2_content/icons/cb_decal_square_53468fe0799b424f995509d03be6bfa8.png","foregroundIcon":"https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny2_content/icons/cb_decal_square_c0ecd484a44c9aa934f9fb67e1ac1108.png","backgroundColor":"#111112","emblemColor2":"#111112","emblemColor1":"#F0F0F0","description":"ERM","motto":"ERM","tag":"ERM","name":"ERM"},{"groupId":2938801,"medalUnlocks":[{"medalTier":1,"count":5,"unlockId":7,"description":"Finished in the top 3 of a Company division event","name":"Top 3 Company"},{"medalTier":1,"count":8,"unlockId":10,"description":"Finished in the top 10 of a Company division event","name":"Top 10 Company"},{"medalTier":2,"count":1,"unlockId":2,"description":"Finished first place in a Platoon division event","name":"First Platoon"},{"medalTier":1,"count":1,"unlockId":8,"description":"Finished in the top 3 of a Platoon division event","name":"Top 3 Platoon"},{"medalTier":1,"count":1,"unlockId":11,"description":"Finished in the top 10 of a Platoon division event","name":"Top 10 Platoon"},{"medalTier":1,"count":29,"unlockId":5,"description":"Had over 50% clan member participation in an event","name":"The more you give, the more you get"},{"medalTier":3,"count":1,"unlockId":20,"description":"You had at least one clan member successfully beat the Garden of Salvation raid in the first 48 hours of it's launch","name":"Garden of Salvation Clan Award"},{"medalTier":2,"count":1,"unlockId":23,"description":"Took part in an an event sponsored by the Order of Saint-14","name":"Effort of Saint-14"},{"medalTier":2,"count":1,"unlockId":24,"description":"Took part in an an event sponsored by the Order of Saint-14","name":"Nightmare of Saint-14"},{"medalTier":2,"count":1,"unlockId":6,"description":"Had over 75% clan member participation in an event","name":"Everything but the kitchen sink"},{"medalTier":2,"count":1,"unlockId":25,"description":"Took part in an an event sponsored by the Order of Saint-14","name":"Raider of Saint-14"}],"backgroundIcon":"https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny2_content/icons/cb_decal_square_382464cf640f1e22de3e1099428bb07a.png","foregroundIcon":"https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny2_content/icons/cb_decal_square_9edc72700cc9454c575f557a11d1e611.png","backgroundColor":"#D383E2","emblemColor2":"#D351D1","emblemColor1":"#F0F0F0","description":"We're here to wear pink and chew berbblegerm.

We are very active and organize our games using our the100.io group. We have a great blend of PVE and PVP members, especially during Iron Banner times. We are always willing to help our members get things accomplished such as exotic bounties, missions, and raid clears.

There, surrounded by hostile strangers, he built a life and there, against all odds, against the merciless logic of the universe itself, he thrived.\nZiyal: By becoming the greatest tailor in the galaxy.\nGarak: And the moral of the story, my dear, is to never underestimate my gift for survival.","motto":"Look around.

So come join us for some social shower power hour fun.\n\nAnd remember what happens in the cosmodrome stays in the cosmodrome, except harpies, that will VEX you for life.","motto":"I kissed a shank and I liked it","tag":"HERP","name":"Has Harpies"},{"groupId":3213478,"medalUnlocks":[{"medalTier":1,"count":1,"unlockId":12,"description":"Finished in the top 10 of a Squad division event","name":"Top 10 Squad"},{"medalTier":1,"count":2,"unlockId":5,"description":"Had over 50% clan member participation in an event","name":"The more you give, the more you get"}],"backgroundIcon":"https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny2_content/icons/cb_decal_square_992878861157c91bdc3206b50fb2b912.png","foregroundIcon":"https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny2_content/icons/cb_decal_square_d9bc14a63c1eb85be0417dda98a1a6a0.png","backgroundColor":"#F0F0F0","emblemColor2":"#1C1C23","emblemColor1":"#E8C834","description":"Can carry you flawless, but have no idea how to raid still.","motto":"Not as sweaty as the clan makes us out to be, please be gentle.","tag":"&#8800;","name":"Has No Equal"},{"groupId":1306070,"medalUnlocks":[{"medalTier":2,"count":1,"unlockId":23,"description":"Took part in an an event sponsored by the Order of Saint-14","name":"Effort of Saint-14"},{"medalTier":2,"count":1,"unlockId":24,"description":"Took part in an an event sponsored by the Order of Saint-14","name":"Nightmare of Saint-14"},{"medalTier":2,"count":1,"unlockId":25,"description":"Took part in an an event sponsored by the Order of Saint-14","name":"Raider of Saint-14"}],"backgroundIcon":"https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny2_content/icons/cb_decal_square_a924d1935aeefa72214bd111a4bd0118.png","foregroundIcon":"https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny2_content/icons/cb_decal_square_d7cfd84e154ef625feb934cad3b17be6.png","backgroundColor":"#111112","emblemColor2":"#F0F0F0","emblemColor1":"#111112","description":"We has no House.

Fun first, skill next, that's the order of business.\n\n*must have a mic\n**must be above 18","motto":"No Salt , Lets keep gaming fun !!","tag":"MNTL","name":"Magic Space Monkeys&#8482;"},{"groupId":3707643,"medalUnlocks":[{"medalTier":1,"count":3,"unlockId":5,"description":"Had over 50% clan member participation in an event","name":"The more you give, the more you get"},{"medalTier":2,"count":1,"unlockId":23,"description":"Took part in an an event sponsored by the Order of Saint-14","name":"Effort of Saint-14"},{"medalTier":2,"count":1,"unlockId":24,"description":"Took part in an an event sponsored by the Order of Saint-14","name":"Nightmare of Saint-14"},{"medalTier":2,"count":1,"unlockId":6,"description":"Had over 75% clan member participation in an event","name":"Everything but the kitchen sink"},{"medalTier":2,"count":1,"unlockId":25,"description":"Took part in an an event sponsored by the Order of Saint-14","name":"Raider of Saint-14"}],"backgroundIcon":"https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny2_content/icons/cb_decal_square_9539b08afd42259aa1efe8b083928d48.png","foregroundIcon":"https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny2_content/icons/cb_decal_square_236989d57e958a21a0fad20f52ef8f8c.png","backgroundColor":"#7E7E7E","emblemColor2":"#111112","emblemColor1":"#F0F0F0","description":"Recruiting.","motto":"You must either modify your dreams or magnify your skills","tag":"M","name":"Magnify"},{"groupId":3965767,"medalUnlocks":[{"medalTier":1,"count":8,"unlockId":5,"description":"Had over 50% clan member participation in an event","name":"The more you give, the more you get"},{"medalTier":2,"count":3,"unlockId":6,"description":"Had over 75% clan member participation in an event","name":"Everything but the kitchen sink"},{"medalTier":1,"count":3,"unlockId":11,"description":"Finished in the top 10 of a Platoon division event","name":"Top 10 Platoon"},{"medalTier":2,"count":1,"unlockId":23,"description":"Took part in an an event sponsored by the Order of Saint-14","name":"Effort of Saint-14"},{"medalTier":2,"count":1,"unlockId":24,"description":"Took part in an an event sponsored by the Order of Saint-14","name":"Nightmare of Saint-14"},{"medalTier":2,"count":2,"unlockId":2,"description":"Finished first place in a Platoon division event","name":"First Platoon"},{"medalTier":1,"count":2,"unlockId":8,"description":"Finished in the top 3 of a Platoon division event","name":"Top 3 Platoon"},{"medalTier":3,"count":1,"unlockId":4,"description":"Finished with the highest score overall for an event","name":"The Best of the Best"},{"medalTier":3,"count":1,"unlockId":22,"description":"Won an event sponsored by the Order of Saint-14","name":"Pride of Saint-14"},{"medalTier":2,"count":1,"unlockId":25,"description":"Took part in an an event sponsored by the Order of Saint-14","name":"Raider of Saint-14"}],"backgroundIcon":"https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny2_content/icons/cb_decal_square_7b0b991eff3abce1f4f83d1ac7df8a15.png","foregroundIcon":"https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny2_content/icons/cb_decal_square_d7a4febde6eb834098cdd0ae6ae35bed.png","backgroundColor":"#111112","emblemColor2":"#5BE7DE","emblemColor1":"#24252E","description":"PVE/Raid:\n3pts Challenger Speed Rank\n2pts Challenger Full Clears Rank\n2pts 201-500 / 1pt 501-1000 Masters Speed Rank\n1pts Masters Full Clears Rank\n1pt Year 1 Low-Mans \n1pt All Year 1 Flawlesses \n1pt Year 2 Low-Mans\n1pt All Year 2 Flawlesses \n1pt Year 3 Low-Mans\n1pt Year 3 Flawlesses\n2pts Day 1 Badge in Any Raid\n2pts Solo Argos/ 1pt SoloQueenswalk\n ----------------------------------\n\nMust have 4 points total","motto":"The raiders who raid the Most and the Fastest","tag":"&#9829;","name":"MaIice&#8482;"},{"groupId":2016534,"medalUnlocks":[{"medalTier":2,"count":1,"unlockId":23,"description":"Took part in an an event sponsored by the Order of Saint-14","name":"Effort of Saint-14"},{"medalTier":2,"count":1,"unlockId":24,"description":"Took part in an an event sponsored by the Order of Saint-14","name":"Nightmare of Saint-14"},{"medalTier":2,"count":1,"unlockId":25,"description":"Took part in an an event sponsored by the Order of Saint-14","name":"Raider of Saint-14"}],"backgroundIcon":"https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny2_content/icons/cb_decal_square_9539b08afd42259aa1efe8b083928d48.png","foregroundIcon":"https://www.bungie.net/common/destiny2_content/icons/cb_decal_square_236989d57e958a21a0fad20f52ef8f8c.png","backgroundColor":"#E8C834","emblemColor2":"#F0F0F0","emblemColor1":"#111112","description":"''The most tremendous, most luxurious clan, in the history of clans'' \n\nNever forget:\nOperations run seven days a week\n\nFirst and foremost,\nAcademics are \nTerribly mistaken. \n\nChildren need to \nHave a positive\nInfluence or they will become \nCorrupted by\nKung-Fu movies and \nSumo wrestling.\n\n\n\nDeath before dishonor.","motto":"Ascendit Fumus Quotidie Viriditas -

We do this to de-stress and have fun. We also believe video games are way more fun with a group of friends than solo. Many of us are older, but by no means is our clan super restrictive, all decent human beings (18+) are welcome.
